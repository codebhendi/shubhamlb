For the eyes of the world,  
see you as shown,  
but for the love of mine,  
beauty different I have known.


Kindness of the purest,  
heart of gold,  
world can be on fire,  
you will bring the cold.


All pain and sorrow you see,  
still choose unceasingly to stay,  
help through all the wicked times,  
make everyone go hurray.


Give merry ten folds,  
joy can be seen in her eyes,  
beautiful song her walk,  
every night then she cries.


River in her bosom,  
refreshing her presence to all,  
but just too cold to the soul,  
what is the path to her fall.


Can we find the truth?  
donâ€™t you ever see,  
for this beauty and her glory,  
her savior do I need be?
