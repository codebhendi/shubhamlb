description: "How people you ideolize can fall from grace"

Good people are rare,  
Even rarer are the unbroken ones,  
The ones who stick to the path,  
Through thick and thin,  
The white knight in the modern fight,  
Ones who stand tall when the storm comes,  
They don’t falter and succumb  
to the sadness and anguish,


Some do give in to the uglies,  
Some good people just lose sometimes,  
Greatness stumbles,  
I see them falling,  
I see them making mistakes,  
Then they reach the old poison  
to blow away the pain,


The heroes of the common men are lost,  
The last ray of sunshine starts to falter,  
But they are the hope in the grim days,  
How shall I muster the courage to be good,  
When all the good is tainted,  
What will I do when the darkness returns,  
Whom shall I remember when  
all that I admired is dead?


They take all the pain in,  
A cry never uttered for help but we go,  
Don’t intervene in their business,  
Smile they all and cry they never,  
Keep the front up, for whom I want to know,  
Sometimes the ideals need to fall down  
and be picked up once again,


Indeed I am not allowed,


But yes I do care.
