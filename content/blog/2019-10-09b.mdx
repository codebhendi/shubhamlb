Sleepless and tired every day,  
Working for hours no one remembers,  
Daylight and moonlight don’t get a say,  
Her clock is her own she says,  
Queen of night, her struggle initiates,  
Raise our hats to every hardworking girl.


Her own eyes tell the story,  
Of how they broke the rules of sleep,  
Sky commands​ world to witness the sunrise,  
Humanity rises and she falls asleep,  
Even in dreams her spirits don’t rest,  
Nights don’t dare touch hardworking girl,


Bags under her eyes and still she won’t quit,  
Goals and dreams always chasing,  
Still she creates time to help a dimwit,  
He humbly praises God for her being,  
Touches every soul she ever meets,  
Words are too small for that girl.


Some people say she is a myth,  
Around every corner I find her,  
Shies away strongest metal by any smith,  
The fire inside her so severe, world will defer,  
Her determination will make you weep in her praise,  
The story of every women this hardworking girl.
