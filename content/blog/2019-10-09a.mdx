Smile we all wished and smile she did,  
The dazzle diminishes away your quips,  
Her happiness makes you less worried,  
Shown by a simple twirl of her lips,


Widen that gap and she creates laughter,  
New joy oozes in the atmosphere  
smell of mud after first rain and we believe her,  
just how simply she hides the shrike.


The nature of a smile is simple,  
The dangers of it are tremendous,  
Like a clownâ€™s laughter no one can ever tell,  
What to expect when the humor ends?


More I smile more I wonder,  
What has a smile become?  
The reminder that a moment has gotten lighter,  
Or a cruel disguise for pain.


Drops her guard I think when she smiles,  
On guard all the time she is from the world,  
Not a hint of the pain on her cheeks,  
The cry for help stifles inside by simple twirl,


I go away thinking she is happy,  
Never she revails the pang in her chest,  
Never she cries in front of me,  
The queen of pain she became.


Adventures of a man too simple,  
Start and end when nothing is in sight,  
Sends me off with smiles, nothing but lies,  
Weight on my heart gives in without a fight,


Inside her broken soul, for help she wishes,  
No one will see, a moaning heart full of pain,  
Knowing this again she just smiles,  
Cruel disguise, she covers her again.


Her night dies in screams of pain and anguish,  
Morning with rush of anxiety,  
To keep such pretense is not easy,  
Every single moment is brutality.


Each smile is a shard of ice in heart,  
Each laugh a hidden cry,  
She whispers but no one hears,  
Cruel game will never cease how hard she try.
