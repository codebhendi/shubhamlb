description: "Change and how to accept it"

I have never felt  
The winds of change  
What makes a man go  
From pain to revenge  


In the day some moan  
By night may rejoice  
For some it is bad  
From some too nice


Fever may be induced  
Sudden turmoil even a heartache  
Comes on whose whim  
No way out, this is how to take


How do we accept  
There is no choice  
Even in torment, take it  
No matter, pay the price  


Accept, adapt and survive  
Life was never fair but always a fight  
Change is forever  
Battle from dark to light
