Top of theÂ world  
Beaming to the world  
My heart is just flushed  
Find out my reason


But will not be rushed  
To explore the meaning  
What is the need  
Can shout with a sore throat


To the world pay no heed  
Dance to the rhythm  
I see no reason to not  
The world may be on fire


Danger not too hot  
Choose in the sadness  
Lay down curled  
Or like me, my love,  
On top of the world
