Life is not a gift,  
then what else is it,  
a hurdle race, maybe,  
but are they there to stop.


Ask yourself did you lose hope,  
did you ever despair,  
why didn’t you give in,  
anger came and you lived.


But why are you saving,  
those regrets of old,  
why you go to compare,  
with people you care no more.


You have an ambition,  
desire you want to achieve,  
dream you can’t unsee,  
don’t sleep then in sadness.


Fight back the tears,  
no moment to spare,  
conquer your fears,  
then your gift can emerge.
