What am I supposed to do when I am with you?  
How to break this ice formed,  
I know this is making you fee blue,  
want to get all from this short time we borrowed.


Awkward, shy and misery I feel,   
when you are around,   
just run away on a wheel,   
but here you are binding me to this ground.


Was your friend till now,   
but want to be more,   
scared of losing you, why and how   
never even had you before.


Help me break this wall,   
how to when I can't even talk,   
can you grant me a wish small,   
for once let's quit all the talk and just walk.


I know together we are a radio,   
with batteries juiced up and no end,   
and still, I have so much to know,   
and here I just have this weekend.


Now in this starless night,   
let's walk along, side by side,   
it would have never felt so right,   
such a simple walk outside.


Hoping closer we will be together,   
distances we have will fade away,   
I know, shouldn't have felt this way,   
this love got in two friends' way.


Walk away later, I know you want,   
but just walk today with me,   
destiny telling us to jaunt,   
forget about all, stay here and for a few moments just be.


Moonlight be our guide,   
for two knowing strangers stuck together,   
walking down the lane side by side,   
hoping to god this will end never.


But I know that you got to go,   
this is just my misery to bare,   
you always loved someone else, so,   
just walk till the end and I will leave to somewhere.


To a place where maybe I will forget,   
you ever in my life was,   
the girl I wished but never met,   
I met once, then destiny had no love clause.


This walk is all I will have to,   
remember you by,   
going to what always your dream drew,   
gone will you be and here I will sigh.


Greatest time I ever had,   
was when I walked that night,   
nothing was bad,   
and no future was also near my sight.


Hey, this memory will be cherished,   
you surely will always be loved,   
somewhere in the corner of my lonely heart,   
the thought of a woman,   
was perfect but just not for me.
