description: "What I can never do"

It may be raining  
Ounces of water  
But I will get  
Wet I think never


Sun can be warm  
Light my inner fire  
But I will be  
Enlightened I think never


Joy is bursting outside  
Heavenâ€™s grace on all  
But will I be  
Blessed I will be never


Help all over the world  
Rescue all from their demons  
But will be  
Saved I will be never


Your love you unfurl  
To each human ever gazed  
Can the love of mine  
I just hope in the eternity once ever
