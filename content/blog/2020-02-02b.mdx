What is a fresh start?  
scared to continue, this never-ending strfie,  
reset variables all, to the point of beginning,  
why not take the scars, pain, to the end of life.


Weapons of old can be burnt,  
shield, ancient defenses may come down,  
old ways, past, melt it, waste it no more,  
new way are to be forged, where uknown.


Wildfire you did enter,  
out now, navigated this maze enough,  
old cloths now defabricated,  
travel en route naked.


For the storm is home no more,  
change occurred, show it donâ€™t run,  
who is the new you?  
time to embrace adventure, tainted one.


You know, how the ship,  
embraces the waves, ready to leave any all shores,  
stay on the banks, be timid, never can be,  
now waiting when the blue beast roars.
