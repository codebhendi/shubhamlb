Hi,


There have been long gaps between me writing these blogs. I can give no reason and frankly at this point I do believe that no one cares. So here I can right all my problems publicly and no one will actually give a fuck.


Then, I have left my last job and have joined a new organization. This is my first month working there and till now it has been fun. I have always wanted to work in JavaScript in the hopes of improving my knowledge regarding it. Now I can finally work in JS and also I get to work in python which has been holding my hand and carrying me forward for the last entire year. Java and Android are there in the skill set but I really don't want to go down that rabbit hole again. I can do some react-native but again not right now.


We are working in microservice architecture and most of the stack will be in node.js. The front end will be created using react and semantic UI (which is the best UI framework and it has a react version too). For the modules (trade secret) we will be using python as the service they will be providing will be written in python. For those modules, I will be creating a Django or flask web app wrapper. The cool thing about microservice architecture is that you have a bunch of technologies that are good for certain tasks and you will be using them for those certain tasks only. There is no need for using a less effective tool for anything, you can use the best to get the best results.


Other than work my personal life is a huge pot of hot burning mess. Nothing is fine, like literally every single moment I am trying to have fun in the back of my mind I am thinking how many people I had to lie to enjoy this one moment and all of them I am hurting. Currently, I have just become a ping pong ball and no one is happy. Yeah, like things were any different before. They were the same and I am still the same.


On the note of problems, I am also facing some financial difficulties and I am in no position to ask people for money. I have to sort this problem at least on my own because it was me and my foolish spending on stuff that got me here in the first place. I have to somehow save money clear whatever troubles I am facing keep a happy face and show everyone that I am doing good. They can help me I know but I have been living in some people's debt for a long time and I want to live with no debt for some time even if it means sacrificing some friends, relationships and maybe a few things that I enjoy, I think it will be all worth it. I have been long since trying to make people happy and that has caused people around me some real pain. They want to see me happy and I have no clue if it even exists. Yeah, it is a mess. This is not a technical blog if you are still wondering if there is gonna be mention of some other difficulties I am facing. This is going to be a rant. I started with the tech part as I thought I might distract myself but alas!


Things were looking good for me at the beginning of the year, I was wondering back then when things were gonna go bad and they did pretty quickly, on every single front. Soon, there will be a day when I think I am going to lose all my support and eagerly waiting for that day. I want everyone to see this defeated face once which I have seen so many times and realize who the fuck I am and stay the fuck away from me. That's when I think I can move around with no care for judgment, But till then scared I walk that they will discover that this is all a facade.


Given how things are going I may well be in for a big treat but I have my doubts regarding what department it will go in. Life definitely will not bless with a love interest, as far as I also care I must let as few people as possible to get their lives touched by me. If you want someone to fuck up your nice life, come to me. So on this depressing note let me end this or I will not work today.
